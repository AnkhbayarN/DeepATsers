Data Availability
This repository contains the following data and code related to the project:

Experimental Spectra: 
The generated spectra were measured using a portable Raman Spectroscopic Apparatus Rapid-785 (Phansco Co. Limited, Taiwan).
These spectra are located in the experimental_sample folder.

Data Extraction:
Data extracted using EMSA, Gaussian noise, and GAN techniques are available in the augmentation folder.

Clinical Samples:
Clinical samples were collected over 5 consecutive days from two patients confirmed to have COVID-19 through PCR testing.
These samples are located in the clinical_sample folder.

Data Augmentation:
The data augmentation was performed using a generative neural network.
The corresponding Python code can be found in the GAN folder.
